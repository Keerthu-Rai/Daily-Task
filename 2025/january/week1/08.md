Task completed as follows as:

1. Created Lists for "Employee Management":
	I made three lists to manage employee information. The Employee List is the main one, and the Department List and Designation List are linked to it. These lists help me organize employee details by their department and job title.

2. Linked the Employee List to the Department and Designation Lists:
	I connected the Employee List to the Department and Designation Lists. This way, I can easily match employees with their departments and job titles.

3. Created a Document Library with a Column Pointing to the Employee List:
	I set up a Document Library to store files and added a column that links to the Employee List. This allows me to link documents (like employee contracts) to the specific employees.

4. Added Employees to the Employee List:
	I added information about each employee to the Employee List, including their name, department, and job title.

5. Created Different Views for the Employee List:
	I made different views of the Employee List to organize it better. These views allow me to sort or filter the data, making it easier to find certain employees.

6. Added a List View to the SharePoint Site for Easy Navigation:
	I added a List View to the SharePoint site so it’s easier for users to navigate through the Employee List. It makes finding information simple and fast.
